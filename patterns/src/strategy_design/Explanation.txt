********* STRATEGY DESIGN PATTERN ***********

** There is no way of re-using similar code by two different child classes in Inheritance. Features and behaviour only shared in fashion
   parent -> child -> grand child -> ...so on.

** When two different child use same code, it creates the problem of code duplicacy and hampers the scalability of system.

** This pattern makes the use of Strategies ( Interfaces and its implementation ) that can be used as constructor injection by different child and re-use
   the similar code.

** This improves code re-usability and hence promotes scalability in system.
